#SSH_ENABLED="YES"

# Where we should listen for SSH connections if SSH_ENABLED is
# anything other than empty.

#NEW_INCIDENT_TIMEOUT="60"
#
# Environment: NEW_INCIDENT_TIMEOUT.
# Alerts incoming at roughly the same time are grouped into incidents.
# Use this to configure the timeout after which alerts will be
# considered separate incidents, in minutes.
# Example: If it is set for 30 minutes, and alerts come at 09:00,
# 09:20, 09:40, and 11:00, then the first 3 will be the same incident and
# the last one will begin a new incident.
# Default value: 60 (i.e. 1 hour).
